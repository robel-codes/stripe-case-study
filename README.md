## Overview and Origin

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com)

- Stripe is financial services and software as a service(SaaS) company that primarily offers payment processing software and application programming interfaces(APIs) for e-commerce websites and mobile applications.

- Stripe, founded by brothers Patrick and John Collision in Palo Alto, California, in 2010. The company received investment of $2 million including from PayPal co-founders Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, venture capital firms Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and SV Angel.

- In early 2010 John and Patrick Collision began working on Stripe together. At the time Patrick was working on several sie projects and they debated why it was so difficult to accept payments on the web. They sought to solve the problem and see if it was posssible to make it simple - really simple. The next 6-monts they played with it, showed it to friends, and saw how people interacted with it iterating along the way.Within 2-weeks of building the prototype they have thier first transaction with a Y Combinator company called 280 North.

- Stripe if fundded by 50 investors with Ethos VC and National Treasury Managment Agency(NTMA) beign the most recent investors.According to CrunchBase Insights data, Stripe has raised a total of $2.3 billion across 20 funding rounds.

## Business Activities

- Until Stripe came along, setting up a way to accept credit card payments, especially online, was a major headache. It required working with an existing merchant services company and setting up complex systems and integrations. The collison brothers saw how complicated it was and figured there must be a way to make it more simple. They solved the probelem by making it possible to accept payments simply by adding a few lines of code to your website. That doesn't mean that acceptng payments online doesn't still involve complicated processes, but to the end user, non ot that maters. Strip does it all.

- Part of that simplicity was the ease with which you could connect Stripe to almost any online platform. Strip has prebuilt integrations with Squarespace,memberful, shopify, and BigCommerce, along with hundreds of others. That means, even if you aren't a developer, and dont't know anyting about code, you can still easily set up your site to use stripe.

- stripes customer base is primarily buisnesses, startups an entrepeneurs that are seeking a simpler way to handle the payment process of their company.Over time, Stripe has become, for many small businesses, the default option when thinking about how to accept payments online. That's especially true as millions of people had to figure out different ways to do business online over the past year. In addition Stripe has long been known for providing incredible customer support and service. That goes a long way considering a lot of those customers are small businesses that aren't experts on things like websites or code or payment processing.

- Businesses, startups, and entrepneus use Stripe's platform because it offers multiple tools other than payments and its API makes it easier for many developers to work with.

- Stripe uses many technologies including application and framework such as Ruby, NSQ, Apache Impala Utilites, Google Analytics, Amazon Route 53, Maligun, Mandrill, Framer DevOps, CircleCI, PagerDuty.

## Landscape

- Stripe falls under the Payments/Billing domain in FinTech.

- This domain has be one of the most affected by technology in the past 5-10 years. With the rise of smarphones and we moved from physical payments with cas or credit carts to digial payments with our phones.

- Some of the other companis in this domain include Paypal, Square, WePay and Adyen.

## Results

- Stipe has helped businesses, startups and entrepeneurs have easy access to the online platform for paying processing.

- To Measure Stripe’s success in the Payments and Processing Fintech Domain, three main metrics known as KPI’s, which are key performance indicators that measurs different aspects of the payment system must be analysed. The first metric is the Payment Conversion Rate, which quantifies the amount of transactions which were declined. In 2017, Stripe had accounted for 5.3% of transactions had failed. The second KPI reflects the annual gross transaction volume exceed $300 billion in 2020 alone. The final KPI which will be used is the overall revenue growth rate, for-which equates to a 393% increase from $1.5 billion to $7.4 billion respectively.

- To compare Stripe’s performance relative to its competitors in the domain, both PayPal and Square. Zacks Investment Research recorded PayPal had accounted for 9% of transactions had failed, and PayPals 2021 Annal Report identified the annual gross transaction volume of $936 billion. Thus, PayPal’s revenue growth increased by 18.26% from 2020, to account for $25.371 billion. Furthemore, due to Square’s policy which does not allow merchants to accept payments upwards of $50,000, it is unreasonable to compare the Payment Conversion Rate, thus the annual gross transaction volume will be accounted for, which resulted in $45.4 billion in 2021. Additionally, Square’s overall revenue growth rate totalled a 25.74% increase which came in at $3.8 billion. Therefore, based on the core metrics documented, it is evident to suggest that Stripe are successfully operating, as they have been able to maintain growth throughout its life cycle, and accumulates respective annual growth, as well as offering superior services, in relation to Square’s inability to accept large amounts of capital.

## Recommendations

- I would recommend to start peer to peer money transfer service like zelle, or cashapp. with there is of API intergration this can potentially enable them to dominate the payment processing domain.
